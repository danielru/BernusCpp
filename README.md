C++ BERNUS MODEL  {#mainpage}
================

A C++ implementation of the Bernus ion channel model for electrocardiology. The model has been introduced in the following paper: O. Bernus, R. Wilders, C. W. Zemlin, H. Verschelde, A. V. Panfilov: "A computationally efficient electrophysiological model of human ventricular cells"; Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 282: H2296-H2308, 2002.

A concise summary of the involved equations can be found [here](https://models.physiomeproject.org/e/5/bernus_wilders_zemlin_verschelde_panfilov_2002.cellml/view).
In addition, the [documentation](http://www.potse.nl/software/propag/bernus.pdf) of the C implementation of the Bernus model in the PROPAG heart model by M. Potse also contains many details on the Bernus model.
